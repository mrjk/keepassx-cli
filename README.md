# KeepassX-CLI

A dumb KeepassXC reader for shell scripts, with automated unlock. This script exists because Keepass database tends
to be difficult to use programmatically in scripts or in automation.

`keepassx-cli` provides the following features:

- Manage keepass database password in local keyring
- Allow to use different databases
- Very flexible CLI
- Easy secret discovery
- Profile management

Last stable version is: `0.0.2`

mise plugin install keepassx-cli https://github.com/mrjk/asdf-keepassx-cli.git
mise use keepassx-cli

# With asdf
asdf plugin add keepassx-cli https://github.com/mrjk/asdf-keepassx-cli.git
asdf install keepassx-cli latest
asdf global keepassx-cli latest
```

### Install via Curl

chmod +x keepassx-cli
mv keepassx-cli /usr/local/bin/keepassx-cli
```

### Install from Source

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### Basic Usage

Basic usage looks like:
```
keepassx-cli COMMAND PROFILE ARGS...
```

Fetch a password of a given Keepass key name:
```
$ keepassx-cli get perso Personal / github.com / user
Pr1v4TePassword
$ keepassx-cli get pro Corp.com / devops / gitlab.com / buildsvc
Person4alC0rpP4ssw0rd
```

Everything after `get` is considered as a single argument, and spaces does not really matters. Following
statements are equivalent:
```
keepassx-cli get pro Corp.com / devops / gitlab.com / buildsvc
keepassx-cli get pro "Corp.com / devops / gitlab.com / buildsvc"
keepassx-cli get pro "Corp.com/devops/gitlab.com/buildsvc"
keepassx-cli get pro Corp.com/devops/gitlab.com/buildsvc
```

It is possible to see the full entry with:
```
keepassx-cli show pro Corp.com / devops / gitlab.com / buildsvc
```

Fetch attachment:
```
$ keepassx-cli extract pro "Corp.com / devops / infra / certificates" wildcard-cert.key
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
```

Show database as tree or list:
```
keepassx-cli tree pro
keepassx-cli dump pro
```

    Notes: The `dump` and `tree` commands remove duplicates entries

Finally, to enable by default a single profile in your shell (ie, with direnv):
```
eval "$(keepassx-cli shell john)"
```

## Usage

There are some key concepts to work with `keepassx-cli`.

### Configuration

A default configuration is `/.config/keepassx-cli/conf.env`. This configuration is optional, and it is used when no profile is used (see below).


It is always possible to edit configuration with your favorite text editor, the configuration syntax currently accept 2 keys. 

```
$ cat ~/.config/keepassx-cli/conf.env
# Path of the kbdx file
KC_DB=$HOME/Documents/MyVault.kbdx

# Password to unlock kbdx file
# Note: Always prefer to use keyring instead of clear text passwords.
# Leave empty to use keyring or prompt
KC_PASS=
```

    Note: There is no way to save kbdx password in keyring without profile.

### Profile management

Profiles should be managed by the CLI. Profiles live in `~/.config/keepassx-cli/`. Each profile owns its own configuration, and the configuration file `~/.config/keepassx-cli/conf.john.env` must match the `john` profile name.

To create a new profile:
```
keepassx-cli profile add john
```

To list profiles:
```
keepassx-cli profile ls
```

To save profile password (aka kbdx password):
```
keepassx-cli profile password john
```
Password will ideally be saved in local keyring, or directly in clear text in the profile config file.
